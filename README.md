I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus.
After a college education in Math(FSC), and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.

I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Spring Framework, Php, CodeIgniter, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and ReactJS,
but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect
